Both npm and npx are command-line tools associated with Node.js, but they serve different purposes.

Feature	npm (Node Package Manager)	npx (Node Package eXecute)
NPM -Purpose	Manages packages (installing, updating, removing)
Command Use	npm install <package> to install a package
Global Packages	Requires installing global packages (npm install -g <package>)
Example Usage	npm install create-react-app -g â†’
then create-react-app my-app	



NPX- Runs Node.js packages without installing them globally
Installation	Comes with Node.js	Comes with npm (version 5.2+ by default)
npx <package> to run a package without installing
Runs commands directly without global installation
npx create-react-app my-app (runs directly)



Key Differences
npm installs packages, while npx runs packages.

With npm, you need to install a package before using it, whereas npx allows direct execution.

npx helps avoid global installations, ensuring you're using the latest package version without cluttering your system.
When to Use npx?

Running CLI tools like create-react-app without installing them globally.
Using a package version different from the globally installed one.
Running temporary Node.js scripts without permanent installation.
Example Scenarios
âœ… Without npx (Using npm):

sh
Copy
Edit
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
âœ… With npx:

sh
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app my-app
(No need to install globally, it runs once and exits.)

In summary, use npm for package management and npx for executing Node.js commands efficiently. ðŸš€
